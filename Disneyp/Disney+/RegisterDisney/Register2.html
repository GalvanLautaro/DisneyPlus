                    we will notify you no less than thirty (30) days in advance of the amendment by sending an email to the email address you have registered for your Service account.

If you do not agree to any such amendment to this Agreement, you must discontinue using the Service and, consequently, if you do not cancel your subscription before the amendment takes effect,
                    you accept the amendment.<br><br>Starting from the date of your cancellation, you will not be able to access the Service and we will provide you with a prorated refund for the period of time between the date of your cancellation and the end of the billing period. In this case, you should have paid a discounted fee for the annual subscription,
                    the amount to be refunded will be calculated on the basis of this discount. In order to request said refund, you should follow the instructions set forth in the notice provided to you briefly indicating the reasons for such request.<br><br>e. Payment details.

                    such as credit card number and expiration date, on file.

Where your payment details change or are due to expire, we may obtain or receive from your payment provider updated payment details including your card number,
                    expiration date and CVV (or equivalent). This enables us to continue to provide you access to the Service.

If a payment is not successfully authorized due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, we may suspend or terminate your subscription.
                    You also agree that we may charge your payment method on file if you decide to restart your Service subscription.<br><br>f. Subscriptions Obtained Through Authorized Third Parties. If you obtain a Service subscription via an authorized third party (e.g., an app store), that subscription is also subject to that third partys terms,
                    and the provisions in this Subscriber Agreement concerning subscription purchase, billing, cancellation/refunds, and payment do not apply to that subscription to the extent this Subscriber Agreement conflicts with the applicable authorized third party terms. For subscriptions obtained via an authorized third party,
                    your billing relationship will be directly with the applicable third party. Any fees charged for your Service subscription will be billed by the applicable third party using the payment information you have provided to such authorized third party. To cancel a Service subscription obtained via a third party,
                    please follow the cancellation instructions set out by that third party. You can visit our Help Center for instructions on how to cancel a Service subscription obtained via a third party.<br><br>g. Bundled Subscription Options.

There is no free trial for the COMBO+ Offer.
                    <br><br>By purchasing the COMBO+ Offer, you agree that certain account information (e.g., your e-mail address) will be provided to each Bundled Service for purposes of assessing your eligibility for a COMBO+ Offer, activating, administering, improving your experience with the COMBO+ Offer and each Bundled Service,

                    You will continue to be billed by Disney or such third-party that currently bills you for that pre-existing subscription. If you have been given access to Disney+ or STAR+ on a free basis from a third party, you may continue to take advantage of that promotional offer and purchase the COMBO+ Offer.

If you cancel the COMBO+ Offer and did not have a pre-existing subscription, you will lose access to all Bundled Services. If you cancel the COMBO+ Offer but maintain a pre-
                    existing Disney+ or STAR+ subscription, you must independently manage or cancel that subscription. <br><br>i. Premier Access.
